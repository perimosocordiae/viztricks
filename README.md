Recipes and helper functions for plotting with Python + matplotlib

To install, clone this repository and run:

    python setup.py install

matplotlib and numpy are required dependencies, but some of the functions
rely on scipy and/or scikit-learn as well.
To create animated GIFs with `FigureSaver`, imagemagick must be installed
with the `convert` program on the path.
